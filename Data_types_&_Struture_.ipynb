They are important because they improve the efficiency of operations like searching, inserting, and deleting data, help manage memory effectively, and optimize algorithms.

        "Ans: Lists are preferred when\n",
        "The order of elements is important.\n",
        "You need to store a sequence of items that can be accessed by their position (index).\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans: Dictionaries are considered unordered because their key-value pairs are not stored in a specific order (until Python 3.7+, where insertion order is preserved). This means when you iterate over a dictionary, the order of key-value pairs is not guaranteed. However, data retrieval using keys is fast (O(1)).\n",
